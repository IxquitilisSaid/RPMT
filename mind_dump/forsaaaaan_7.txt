Fucking hell, man... Let's just jump to a quick Q&A.

##Why are you building this? {
  - Because I'm fucking tired of people doubting my skills / knowledge as a Dev. 
   - No shit I'm no wizard and I do have some knowledge gaps with really basic stuff, but that's the tradeoff for learning how to run before you can walk.

  - Because I FUCKING LOVE CODING AND JAVASCRIPT
    - Read the line above again

  - Because it sounds really stupid as a concept (fuck Sillicon Valley startup, Starbucks and Allbirds culture) 
    - And I love self deprecating humor
      - "Oh you built some A.I startup that cooks you dinner and tells you that you're Worth It? Dude, I fucking made a Tweet theme-er"

  - I want a dope challenge 
}


##Why do you have ./mind_dump? {
  - I have ADHD, so I constantly write down what I'm thinking / working on.
    - Since I write them as fast as I can, it's pretty "raw" (raw as in "I curse a lot and can't properly format my shit)
  
  - It's a way to log my thought process and stuff. Not like any future Recruiter will look at this and go "Fuck this dude is THE BALLS"
    - Probably won't even get a thank you e-mail
}


##Wait... WHO are you? And who am I?? {
  - I'm some random Luso-Brazilian Jew that lives in Germany. 
    - Fullstack-ish, mostly Frontend & UX/UI
    - Can recite the whole "U.S Marine" copypasta in a drop of a hat

  - Who are you? You are me! I mean... You are you but in the context of `this`, I'm just talking to myself.
}


##Why don't you use X package / A.I / Ouija board for handling the "to be generated" themed text? {
  - Because
    - The whole challenge of this shit is exactly THAT
    - npm install --save deezcojones
    - Because
      - Read line above
      - Recursion
        - Read the line above
        - Recursion
          - Read the line above
          - Recursion
}


##Okay, enough already! Just tell us how the Algorithm / Black Magic / 10 monkeys locked in a room with typewriters works! {
  - Good question! I have no solid idea!
    - I'll just throw stuff against the wall and see what sticks. Don't worry, all iterations will be (or they already are, if you're from the future) below.

  @First attempt (stub) {
    
  }
