Fuck... So the idea that I have basically involves a "Theme Generator" for Twitter.
Let's start small. What do I need?

##Functionality CORE {
  - Come up with a shtick for your Twitter (can be cycled)
  - On generate the User should be able to select the "Strength" of this... Thing
    - Check stuff beneath so it makes sense (this was made by 09/05/19 Gondola, so good luck future Me :^)
      - It's 1 hour later and I'm already starting to forget what I meant with the line above... Fuck you past me
  - Take your Username / Name and make a new one with the Theme
  - Take your Bio and adapt it to fit the created Theme
  - Generate an example tweet that can be posted on click
    - Something something allow user to pick from theme related key-words and / or add their own for the tweets
}




Now regarding the Themes... I'll just start with hardcoded shit. 
Listen, I ain't some A.I dev or whatever. Just your run-of-the-mill (do you even spell it like that?) Fullstack-ish Dev.

##BASE THEMES (check themestorming.txt for deets) {
  - GoT 
    - Arya
    - Patchface
    - Clegane
  - "'Murrican" (AKA Ken FUCKING Wheeler)
  - Cowboy
  - Weeb
  - Silicon Valley
}




Some of these are probably out of my knowledge scope (or Twitter's API) but let's keep'em here. 
Just for funsies :p

**IDEAS TO MATURE {
  - Create some sort of filter to also edit your profile Picture
    - Should be soft (adding a small theme related sticker) or HÃ–RD (elon musk with Ed profile pic lvl)

  - Something something apply a theme filter for the tweets sent
    - At runtime (via webapp / app) || Trigger on post, apply stuff, post it and delete the original *shrug*
    - Should have a selectable range so the user doesn't have to manually do that

  - Should make a Theme Creator for Users to make their own or something
